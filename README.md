- The revenue made by Coco-Cola contributed nearly one-fourth (23%) to the overall total sales, and individually it is the highest revenue earning product while Dasani Water is in the 2nd position (20%). 
- The profit made by Coco-Cola contributed one-fourth (25%) to the overall total profit while Dasani Water is in the 2nd place (21%).  
- Out of the five regions, the region “West” earned the highest revenue, and the maximum profit in the year 2021.
